<h2><a id="sec1">Arithmetic and Logic Unit</a></h2>
	<div><p>The Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) performs the computing functions. The accumulator
is an 8 – bit register. In arithmetic and logical operations, one of the operands is present in 
6
Module – 1 TCE, DSCE
‘A’ register. After the arithmetic or logical operations being performed, the result is stored
in ‘A’ register and the status of the ALU operations will be reflecting in the status flag
register (PSW) of 8051.</p></div>

<h2><a id="sec2">Program status word</a></h2>
<div><p>The program status word (PSW) register is an 8 – bit register. It is also referred as the flag
register. Although the PSW register is 8 – bit wide, only 6 bits of it are used by the 8051.
The two unused bits are user – definable bits. Four of the flags are called conditional flags,
meaning that they indicate some conditions that result after an instruction is executed. These
four flags are CY (Carry), AC (Auxiliary Cary), P (Parity) and OV (Overflow).</p></div>

	<h2>Memory</h2>
	<div><p>&quot;The 8051 have 4KB of on chip program memory (ROM), 128 Bytes of on chip data memory
(RAM) and 21 bytes meant for Special function registers (SFR). The following diagram
shows the programming model of 8051 Microcontroller&quot;</p></div></section>
